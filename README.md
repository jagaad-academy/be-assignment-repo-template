# Assignment Template

This repository is a template for student assignments. It contains the following folder structure:



Each module contains 4 chapters, and each chapter contains multiple exercises and 1 project. In addition, each module has a project folder, which is for larger projects that span multiple chapters. The solutions to the exercises should be placed in the "solutions" folder within each exercise, and the project should be placed in the "project" folder within each chapter or module.
